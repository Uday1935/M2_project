The aim of this project is to investigate the development of a navigation aid for blind and visually impairedpeople.The paper represents an innovative project design and implementation of an Ultrasonic Navigation system in order to provide fully automatic obstacle avoidance with audible notification for blind pedestrians. This blind guidance system is safe reliable and cost-effective. Ultrasonic sensor and ATtmega328 are used. The distance between the object and the sensor is below 100 cm beep sound is thecircuit. The circuit may be further improved technologically so that it can be used by the blind people.
